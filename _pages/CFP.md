## What and How to Submit 

M3 accepts several types of submissions for review, including:

- Full papers (max 8 pages plus 2 extra pages)
- Short papers (max 4 pages)
- Extended Abstract/Posters (max 2 pages)


Papers that are not accepted by the main conference will be automatically sent to M3 workshop if such option has been selected at submission stage.

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original papers, which have not been published elsewhere and which are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference or workshop.

Paper submissions (full, short and abstract) must use in the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE 2-column format</a>, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. 
All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the workshop, originality, significance, and clarity. 

##### Triple-blind submission guidelines
Authors must not use identifying information in the text of the paper and bibliographies must be referenced to preserve anonymity. 
Any papers available on the Web (including arXiv) no longer qualify for M3 submissions, as their author information is already public.

###### What is triple-blind reviewing?
The traditional blind paper submission hides the referee names from the authors, and the double-blind paper submission also hides the author names from the referees. 
The triple-blind reviewing further hides the referee names among referees during paper discussions before their acceptance decisions. 
The names of authors and referees remain known only to the PC Co-Chairs, and the author names are disclosed only after the ranking and acceptance of submissions are finalized. 
It is imperative that all authors conceal their identity and affiliation information in their paper submissions. 
It does not suffice to simply remove the author names and affiliations from the first page, but also in the content of each paper submission.

## Publication
Following the ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

M3 Co-Chairs are also open to the possibility of publishing a special issue of a journal for the best papers of the workshop.
