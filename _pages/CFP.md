## What and How to Submit 

M3 accepts several types of submissions for review, including:

- Full papers (max 8 pages plus 2 extra pages)
- Short papers (max 4 pages)
- Extended Abstract/Posters (max 2 pages)


Papers not accepted by the main conference will be automatically sent to the M3 workshop if such an option has been chosen at the submission stage.

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original research papers which have not been published elsewhere and which are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference, or workshop.

Paper submissions (full, short, and abstract) must use the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE 2-column format</a>, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. 
All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to the workshop's scope, originality, significance, and clarity. 

To submit a paper, please use the following <a href="https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2023/icdm23/scripts/ws_submit.php?subarea=S">web portal</a>.

##### Triple-blind submission guidelines
Authors must not use identifying information in the text of the paper, and bibliographies must be referenced to preserve anonymity. 

Any contribution that can be already accessed on the WWW (including arXiv) no longer qualifies for M3 submissions, as their author information is already public.

###### What is triple-blind reviewing?
The traditional blind paper submission hides the referee names from the authors, and the double-blind paper submission also hides the author names from the referees. 
The triple-blind reviewing further hides the referee names among referees during paper discussions before their acceptance decisions. 
The names of authors and referees remain known only to the PC Co-Chairs, and the author names are disclosed after the ranking and acceptance of submissions are finalized. 

All authors *must* conceal their identity and affiliation information in their paper submissions. 

It does not suffice to remove the author names and affiliations from the first page but also any reference to them from the research piece submitted for review. 

For additional details, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cloud-conf.net/icdm2023/call-for-papers.html">ICDM 2023 website</a>.

## Publication
Following the ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

M3 Co-Chairs are also open to the possibility of publishing a special issue of a journal for the best papers of the workshop.
