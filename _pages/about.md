I am a Senior Researcher at <span style="color:#408e8f"><b>CNR-ISTI</b></span> and External Prof. at <span style="color:#9a852e"><b>UNIPI</b></span>.

I am also a member of the <span style="color:#00369f"><b>KDD-lab</b></span>: a joint research team that connects the Computer Science Dept. of the University of Pisa, CNR-ISTI, and SNS.

Within the lab, I coordinate the research activities on <span style="color:#a624a6"><b>Complex Network Analysis</b></span>.

My research focuses on modeling, characterizing and forecast emerging (social) behaviors leveraging complex networks and AI/ML techniques.

My recent research spans over the following topics:
- <a href="projects/project-dynamics/">dynamics on and of complex networks</a>;
- <a href="projects/project-netmod/">feature-rich and higher-order network modeling</a>;
- <a href="projects/project-pie/">polluted information environments</a>;
- <a href="projects/project-sie/">online well-being</a>;
- <a href="projects/project-cognetsci/">cognitive network science</a>.

I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities.
